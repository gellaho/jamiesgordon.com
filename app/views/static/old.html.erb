  <p>        
    I'm very involved in a comedy Discord server for the comedy website <%= link_to('https://1900hotdog.com', 'https://1900hotdog.com', class: 'text-blue-700') %>.
    This is where all the stuff I've made for it lives. It's got movies I've made, audiobooks I've done, and a bunch of other inexplicable stuff.

    Unfortunately, it's also probably the most technologically intersting page. It's got an rss feed I built myself, little React games, and
    A ton of data stored in book readings. And actual ActiveRecord stuff.
